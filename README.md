# Project #0: The Game

A web app for the game of Tic Tac Toe (otherwise known as noughts and crosses) built from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery.

Play it with a friend here: https://ml78.github.io/project0-game_ttt/

### Game Strategy
For more information about the game strategy visit: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy)

## Technical Specifications
1. Renders a 3x3 sized game board in the browser.
1. Allows the starting player to select the token, either **X** or __O__, and then switches turns between them.
1. Visually displays when X or O wins if a player gets 3 to line up (in a row, column or diagonally), or shows a draw if neither wins.
1. A _Restart Game_ button is included to reset the game.

## Approach
* The app has separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It endeavours to adhere to best practices:
  * using semantic markup for HTML and CSS; and
  * applying the principles of ***KISS*** (Keep it Simple Stupid) and ***DRY*** (Don't Repeat Yourself).


## Dedication
